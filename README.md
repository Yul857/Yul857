- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Lin Yu-Ming
- I am a software developer with proficiency in Swift, Python, Javascript, React, HTML, and CSS programming languages. I also demonstrate competency in the use of frameworks such as Bootstrap, React, and Node.js in the creation of my projects. I have one year of experience as an accountant which has allowed me to develop excellent problem solving and analyzing skills by sifting through hefty financial records to ensure every detail is accurate and current. I also have a strong interest in mobile app development. I have created multiple iOS applications on the App Store.
